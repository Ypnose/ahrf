Yep, but we'll need to go to this direction: &gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &gt;, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;&gt;&gt;,

with the following replacements:
&lt;rel&gt;   = the release version you are using
&lt;build&gt; = the source date of the build. 20140710* and later will fit
&lt;arch&gt;  = your system's architecture
